/**
 * env.ts — fail-fast guard for required environment variables (F001).
 *
 * WHY: previously `process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN` (and others) were read silently;
 * if a clone-per-client deploy missed an env, the server booted and looked
 * healthy ("Leather Wallah Server is working!" at GET /) but every auth + every
 * upload was broken at runtime. This module validates at boot so misconfigured
 * deploys fail visibly in Coolify health checks instead of looking up but
 * broken.
