/**
 * Demo-seed image helper.
 *
 * Demo products need real-looking photos. We DON'T ship binary assets in the
 * repo; instead each demo image is declared as a stable remote stock-photo URL
 * (see food.ts SOURCE_IMAGES) plus a deterministic slug. On seed we:
 *
 *   1. Build the deterministic S3 key  →  demo/<niche>/<slug>.<ext>
 *   2. If that key already exists in the bucket  →  reuse it (idempotent; a
 *      re-run or a future client of the same niche shares the same upload).
 *   3. Otherwise download the remote photo into memory and push it to S3.
 *
 * Returns { Location, Key } exactly like uploadToSpaces, so the seed stores the
 * permanent CDN URL + key on the product/banner/etc. The remote source URL is
 * NEVER stored — once uploaded the shop is self-hosted and won't break if the
 * stock-photo URL rots.
 *
 * The `demo/<niche>/` folder is intentionally shared across clients of the same
 * niche and is NOT deleted by "Clear demo data" (that only removes DB rows).
