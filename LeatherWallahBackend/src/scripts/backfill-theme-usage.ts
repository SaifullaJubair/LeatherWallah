/**
 * Theme usage-counter repair.
 *
 * Recomputes `themes.used_in_products` from the actual product collection and
 * re-derives `themes.is_deletable` from it.
 *
 * WHY THIS DRIFTED
 * ----------------
 * `deleteProductServices` used a query-level `ProductModel.deleteOne(filter)`.
 * The counter hooks in product.model.ts are registered on `findOneAndDelete`
 * and on a *document-level* `deleteOne` ({ document: true, query: false }) —
 * neither of which a query-level deleteOne triggers. So every deleted themed
 * product left the counter one too high, permanently. Because
 * `is_deletable` is derived as `used_in_products === 0`, themes that no
 * product actually used stayed pinned as non-deletable.
 *
 * `clearDemoDataServices` deletes demo products one-by-one *specifically so the
 * hooks fire* (see its docblock) — so wiping demo data was the fastest way to
 * inflate the counter. That is what a client sees as "this theme says 39
 * products use it" when the catalogue holds 15.
 *
 * The delete path is fixed (findOneAndDelete). This script repairs the docs
 * that drifted before the fix landed.
 *
 * Safe to run repeatedly: it computes absolute truth from a countDocuments()
 * per theme and only writes rows that actually differ.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cd LeatherWallahBackend
 *   # inspect only — writes nothing (default):
 *   node node_modules/ts-node-dev/lib/bin.js --transpile-only src/scripts/backfill-theme-usage.ts
 *   # actually persist:
 *   node node_modules/ts-node-dev/lib/bin.js --transpile-only src/scripts/backfill-theme-usage.ts --apply
