/**
 * fix-pos-billing-fields.ts — one-time backfill (2026-09-22).
 *
 * Why: the Admin POS used to send the customer's location with the two billing
 * fields swapped relative to the storefront —
 *
 *     POS (old):        billing_city = division,  billing_state = district
 *     Storefront:       billing_city = zone,      billing_state = city/division
 *
 * The server derives the shipping zone from `billing_state`
 * (see order.recompute.ts → recomputeShippingCost), so on POS orders that field
 * held a value the server could not interpret. The POS has since been fixed to
 * send the storefront's shape, which leaves the historical POS rows as the only
 * place the old semantics survive. Reports or filters that read `billing_state`
 * as "the city" therefore see two different meanings depending on the row's age.
 * This script rewrites the old rows into the current shape.
 *
 * Scope: ONLY `order_source: "admin"` orders created before the fix, and only
 * those that still look swapped. Storefront orders are never touched.
 *
 * Detection: a row is considered swapped when `billing_city` holds a known
 * Bangladeshi DIVISION name (that is where the POS put the division) while
 * `billing_state` does not. We deliberately do NOT rewrite a row we cannot
 * positively identify — leaving a row alone is always safer than guessing, and
 * the script reports every skipped row so nothing is silently ignored.
 *
 * Ambiguity: "Dhaka", "Rajshahi", "Chattogram", "Khulna", "Barishal", "Sylhet",
 * "Rangpur" and "Mymensingh" are BOTH division and district names. When both
 * fields carry the same value the swap is a no-op, so those rows are counted as
 * already-correct rather than rewritten.
 *
 * Idempotent: running twice is a no-op — after the first pass `billing_city` no
 * longer holds a division name, so the rows stop matching the detector.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cd LeatherWallahBackend
 *   npx ts-node-dev --transpile-only src/scripts/fix-pos-billing-fields.ts          # dry run
 *   npx ts-node-dev --transpile-only src/scripts/fix-pos-billing-fields.ts --apply  # write
 *
 * Always run the dry run first and read the summary. `--apply` is required for
 * any write; without it the script only reports what it would do.
